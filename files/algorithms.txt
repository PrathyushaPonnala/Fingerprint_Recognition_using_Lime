Support Vector Machine (SVM):
Used for classification, distinguishing between genuine and impostor fingerprints.
Specifically, the sklearn.svm.SVC (Support Vector Classification) class is employed with a linear kernel.

Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG):
Used for feature extraction from fingerprint images.
Extracts local gradient information, capturing the distribution of intensity gradients in different parts of the image.

Lime (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations):
Used for providing interpretability to the SVM model's predictions.
Helps in understanding how the SVM model makes predictions for a given instance by approximating the decision boundary around that instance.
